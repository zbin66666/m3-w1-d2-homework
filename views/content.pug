                Was amazing! My Walmart didn’t have coriander in stock and didn’t have ground cumin. I used serrano instead of jalapeño. It was just like my favorite tortilla soup from BJs. I am sending this recipe to my family. I want everyone to try it!

                I just made this soup today and it’s so tasty! didn’t have corn at home but still turned out very good.  It’s a winner!  I made beef chili for my parents; but since my dad has gout he can’t eat beef; this white chicken chili is perfect for him.  Thank you Lisa!

                I LOVE this White Chicken Chili! You are right, it is satiating meal—delicious with toasted bread. Refreshingly different taste than any chicken chili I’ve made in the past. I made it exactly as written and added some chopped zucchini, carrots, and celery. Instead of shredding the chicken, I chopped it into small pieces. It freezes very well. Will be an all-time favorite, for sure.

                This recipe is dynamite! My partner usually won’t eat beans but he finished the whole pot (darn was hoping to have some for leftovers haha). This is crowd-pleaser that I am going to add to my regular recipe rotation. Thanks so much, Lisa!
